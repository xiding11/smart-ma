title: multi-tenant Auth Mode
description: Enable multi-tenancy in your Dittofeed instance.
---

Multi-tenancy, facilitated by the `multi-tenant` "auth mode", allows you to run multiple Dittofeed workspaces on a single instance of Dittofeed. These workspaces allow you to isolate data for different customers, and can be managed programmatically.

The `multi-tenant` auth mode also provides separate workspace member accounts, which can log into Dittofeed using their own credentials and permissions.

The `multi-tenant` auth mode is only available in dittofeed-ee, and Dittofeed cloud. See [dittofeed-ee](/deployment/self-hosted/dittofeed-ee) for more information on installing dittofeed-ee.

## Setup

Multi-tenancy utilizes OIDC ([OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)) for authentication. To enable multi-tenancy, you will need to configure an OIDC provider.

### Auth0

In order to configure Auth0 as an OIDC provider for multi-tenancy, use the following environment variables.

```bash .env
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID='<your-auth0-client-id>'
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET='<your-auth0-client-secret>'
SECRET_KEY='<your-secret-key>'
AUTH_MODE='multi-tenant'
AUTH_PROVIDER='auth0'
SIGNOUT_URL='/dashboard/signout'
# Example: https://dittofeed.us.auth0.com/
OPEN_ID_ISSUER='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/'
OPEN_ID_AUTHORIZATION_URL='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/authorize'
OPEN_ID_TOKEN_URL='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/oauth/token'
OPEN_ID_USER_INFO_URL='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/userinfo'
```

#### Configuring Auth0

In auth0 create a Regular Web Application.

Then in the settings of the application, (`https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dittofeed/applications/<application-id>/settings`) take the following actions.

* Copy the `Client ID` which will be used as the `OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID`.
* Copy the `Client Secret` which will be used as the `OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET`.
* Add a callback URL of the form `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/oauth2/callback`.
* Add a `Logout URL` of the form `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/signout/complete`.
* Add an `Allowed Web Origins` of the form `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>`.
* Allow Cross-Origin Authentication.
* Click Save Changes.


### Generating a Secret Key

See our documentation on [Authentication Modes](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes) for instructions on how to generate a new `SECRET_KEY`.

### AWS Cognito

In order to configure AWS Cognito as an OIDC provider for multi-tenancy, use the following environment variables.

Note that many of these values can be found on your Cognito user pool's `OpenID Connect` settings page.

`https://cognito-idp.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<your-user-pool-id>/.well-known/openid-configuration`


```bash .env
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID='<your-cognito-client-id>'
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET='<your-cognito-client-secret>'
SECRET_KEY='<your-secret-key>'
AUTH_MODE='multi-tenant'
AUTH_PROVIDER='cognito'
SIGNOUT_URL='/dashboard/signout'
OPEN_ID_ISSUER=https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<your-user-pool-id>
OPEN_ID_AUTHORIZATION_URL='https://<your-user-pool-id>.auth.<your-region>.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize'
OPEN_ID_TOKEN_URL='https://<your-user-pool-id>.auth.<your-region>.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token'
OPEN_ID_USER_INFO_URL='https://<your-user-pool-id>.auth.<your-region>.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/userInfo'
OPEN_ID_END_SESSION_ENDPOINT='https://<your-user-pool-id>.auth.<your-region>.amazoncognito.com/logout'
OPEN_ID_RETURN_TO_QUERY_PARAM=logout_uri
```

#### Configuring Cognito

- Create a new user pool using a traditional web application.
- Create a new App client.
- Configure your app client as follows:
  - Set the "Allowed callback Urls": `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/oauth2/callback`
  - Set Allowed sign-out URLs: `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/signout/complete`
  - Select the "OAuth 2.0 grant types": Authorization code grant
  - Select the "OpenID Connect scopes": Email, OpenID, and Profile
